   * @brief Conversion of times between different formats and references.
   *
   * Valuable and very complete documentation on LArSoft timing is described for
   * MicroBooNE by Herbert Greenlee on a document of October 2017 (DocDB 12290).
   * The content in there includes MicroBooNE-specific and general information,
   * and the former is usually clearly distinguished from the latter.
   *
   * The following information is more terse and aimed to the documentation of
   * this service provider rather than to the more general topic of timing in
   * LArSoft.
   *
   *
   * Time definitions
   * =================
   *
   * @anchor DetectorClocksTimeDefinitions
   * Many different components contribute to the operation of a LArTPC, and more
   * are needed for the simulation.
   * Some of the relevant events and time points associated with time are:
   * * *hardware trigger*:
   *     @anchor DetectorClocksHardwareTrigger
   *     the instant the trigger happens or is expected; data acquisition reacts
   *     at this time (_multi-event_)
   * * *beam gate opening*:
   *     @anchor DetectorClocksBeamGateOpening
   *     the instant the beam particles are expected to enter the detector
   *     (_multi-event_)
   * * *software trigger*:
   *     @anchor DetectorClocksSoftwareTrigger
   *     additional logic can provide a more detailed estimation of the physics
   *     event time; this usually comes too late for the electronics time to be
   *     defined by it (_multi-event_)
   * * *electronics start time*:
   *     @anchor DetectorClocksElectronicsStartTime
   *     a reference time instant; this is usually matching the
   *     @ref DetectorClocksTPCelectronicsStartTime "instant the TPC readout starts recording raw digits"
   *     (_multi-event_)
   * * *TPC electronics start time*:
   *     @anchor DetectorClocksTPCelectronicsStartTime
   *     the instant corresponding to the first sample of the raw digits from
   *     TPC; for untampered `raw::RawDigit` objects, this time matches the
   *     general @ref DetectorClocksElectronicsStartTime "electronics start time"
   *     definition, and for the model of data acquisition described here, this
   *     time is by definition function of the
   *     @ref DetectorClocksHardwareTrigger "hardware trigger". Trimmed
   *     `raw::RawDigit` with a start portion clipped away will break the
   *     assumption of electronics time matching the TPC one (which is defined
   *     as seen by `raw::RawDigit`) (_multi-event_)
   * * other electronics start times (*optical detector*, *cosmic ray tagger*,
   *     etc.)
   *     @anchor DetectorClocksOpticalElectronicsStartTime
   *     @anchor DetectorClocksExternalElectronicsStartTime
   *     represent the instant the respective data acquisition subsystems start
   *     digitizing the data from their detectors (_multi-event_)
   * * *event trigger*:
   *     @anchor DetectorClocksExternalEventTrigger
   *     the instant the physics event is detected (in reconstruction jargon
   *     this is a @f$ t_{0} @f$); ideally, for most events involving beam
   *     particles this is the a little after
   *     @ref DetectorClocksBeamGateOpening "beam gate opening", and on top of
   *     the @ref DetectorClocksHardwareTrigger "hardware trigger" (_per event_)
   * * *charge collection*:
   *     @anchor DetectorClocksChargeCollection
   *     the instant the ionisation from a particle reaches the charge readout
   *     (_per particle_)
   * * *photon collection*:
   *     @anchor DetectorClocksPhotonCollection
   *     the instant scintillation photons from a particle reaches the optical
   *     readout (_per particle_)
   * * *physics event time*:
   *     @anchor DetectorClocksPhysicsEvent
   *     the instant the main interaction happens; this is assigned by the event
   *     generator (_per event_)
   * * *Geant4 time start*:
   *     @anchor DetectorClocksGeant4TimeStart
   *     assigned to each particle by the simulation of propagation
   *     through matter (Geant4); note that this is not necessarily the same as
   *     the @ref DetectorClocksPhysicsEvent "event time". (_per event_)
   *
   * In parentheses, it is indicated if such instant is defined for each
   * considered particle, or for the complete physics process ("event") or for
   * all physics processes recorded in the same time window ("multi-event").
   *
   * @anchor DetectorClocksTimeFrameDefinitions
   * We can also define many ways to measure these times with respect to the
   * others. We use the following time scales and frames:
   * * *electronics time*:
   *     @anchor DetectorClocksElectronicsTime
   *     from the
   *     @ref DetectorClocksElectronicsStartTime "electronics start time"; this
   *     is the "glue" time frame connecting most of the others _[&micro;s]_
   * * *TPC time*:
   *     @anchor DetectorClocksTPCelectronicsTime
   *     from the
   *     @ref DetectorClocksTPCelectronicsStartTime "TPC electronics start time"
   *     _[&micro;s]_
   * * other electronics times (
   *     @anchor DetectorClocksOpticalElectronicsTime
   *     *optical electronics time*,
   *     @anchor DetectorClocksExternalElectronicsTime
   *     *external electronics time*, etc.):
   *     from the respective start times; note that in LArSoft the definition of
   *     these times is not fully defined (see
   *     @ref DetectorClocksElectronicsTimesNote "below").
   *     _[&micro;s]_
   * * *beam gate time*:
   *     @anchor DetectorClocksBeamGateTime
   *     from the @ref DetectorClocksBeamGateOpening "beam gate opening time"
   *     _[&micro;s]_
   * * *trigger time*:
   *     @anchor DetectorClocksTriggerTime
   *     from the @ref DetectorClocksHardwareTrigger "hardware trigger"
   *     _[&micro;s]_
   * * *event time*:
   *     @anchor DetectorClocksEventTime
   *     from an @ref DetectorClocksPhysicsEvent "event trigger" _[&micro;s]_
   * * *generation time*:
   *     @anchor DetectorClocksGenerationTime
   *     from the time the generators assigns to the
   *     @ref DetectorClocksPhysicsEvent "main physics event"; this is
   *     stored in the trajectory points of `simb::MCParticle` (usually the
   *     generators store a single trajectory point for each particle) _[ns]_
   * * *Geant4 time*:
   *     @anchor DetectorClocksGeant4Time
   *     from the @ref DetectorClocksGeant4TimeStart "Geant4 time start"; this
   *     is stored into each trajectory point of `simb::MCParticle` produced by
   *     `LArG4` module or equivalent _[ns]_
   * * *simulation time*:
   *     @anchor DetectorClocksSimulationTime
   *     the same as @ref DetectorClocksGeant4Time "Geant4 time" (and also
   *     generation time, which in LArSoft happens to match the former) _[ns]_
   *
   * The list above reports in square brackets the "standard" unit, used for
   * that times in that scale by all LArSoft code unless explicitly specified
   * otherwise.
   * For the times bound to readout, there is also an equivalent tick count time
   * (from the TDC), which is an integral value representing the number of
   * elapsed sampling periods of the detector they refer too (and that period
   * may be different for each piece of hardware). Be sure to read the
   * documentation about the methods you want to use to convert ticks, because
   * their implications and assumptions may be quite subtle.
   *
   *
   * Time conversions
   * =================
   *
   * While this system is carefully designed to give physicists an headache, the
   * `detinfo::DetectorClocks` service provider attempts to tame this complexity
   * by providing methods to convert from one time to the other.
   *
   * The following table represents the available conversion functions, with the
   * time in the first column as the time to be converted and in the columns the
   * times to convert to:

   *
   * Note that the complete definition of optical and external time requires
   * additional information: see the
   * @ref DetectorClocksElectronicsTimesNote "note on electonics time frames"
   * below.
   *
   * The names are not thoroughly consistent, but they roughly follow the
   * following rules:
   * * the "trigger time" is named as `TrigTime` (but see below)
   * * the "beam time" is named as `BeamTime` (but see below)
   * * the @ref DetectorClocksElectronicsTime "electronics time" is named simply
   *     as `Time`; note that e.g. `TriggerTime()` and `BeamGateTime()` must be
   *     read as `Trigger` and `BeamGate` plus `Time()`, that is they return a
   *     `Time` value (i.e., electronics time) of the
   *     @ref DetectorClocksHardwareTrigger "hardware trigger instant" and
   *     @ref DetectorClocksBeamGateOpening "beam gate opening" instant, in the
   *     electronics time frame
   * * the @ref DetectorClocksElectronicsTime "electronics time ticks" are
   *     labelled `TDC`
   * * the @ref DetectorClocksSimulationTime "simulation time" is labelled `G4`
   *     or `G4Time`
   * * `TPCTick` is @ref DetectorClocksTPCelectronicsTime "TPC electronics clock"
   *     ticks, measured from the
   *     @ref DetectorClocksTPCelectronicsStartTime "TPC electronics start time"
   * * `Tick` (without further qualification) is equivalent to "TPCTick" above
   * * `TPC` is usually used in conjunction with `Tick`, where it means
   *   `TPCTick`; but in `TPCG4Time2TDC()` it is a misnomer (the `TDC` wins in
   *   that the result is in ticks in
   *   @ref DetectorClocksElectronicsTime "electronics time" reference, not in
   *   @ref DetectorClocksTPCelectronicsTime "TPC electronics time")
   *
   *
   * @anchor DetectorClocksElectronicsTimesNote
   * Note on electronics time frames
   * --------------------------------
   *
   * The conversion of some electronic time ticks, especially the
   * @ref DetectorClocksOpticalElectronicsTime "optical" and
   * @ref DetectorClocksExternalElectronicsTime "external" ones, assumes that
   * the tick values to be converted are relative to an arbitrary reference,
   * meaning that the absolute (or, e.g., electronics) time for tick `0` is not
   * centrally defined. Instead, it is expected that additional information is
   * provided to locate when this tick `0` actually happens. This is usually
   * done via another pair of arguments, the frame number and the sample number
   * within that frame. In the end, this just moves the questions to when frame
   * `0` sample `0` happens: as those are input arguments, that absolute
   * reference is left to the caller to define; but usually it is referring to
   * the @ref DetectorClocksElectronicsStartTime "electronics start time".
   *
   *
   * @anchor DetectorClocksIntroClocks
   * Clocks
   * -------
   *
   * A clock object (`detinfo::ElecClock`) contains settings for a specific
   * hardware clock. `DetectorClocks` provides four clock objects:
   *
   * clock name        | purpose                               | default time
   * ----------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------
   * `TPCClock()`      | TPC readout and "general" electronics | `TriggerTime()`
   * `OpticalClock()`  | optical detector electronics          | `TriggerTime()`
   * `TriggerClock()`  | hardware trigger electronics          | `TriggerTime()`
   * `ExternalClock()` | _not specified_                       | `TriggerTime()`
   *
   * A clock object _does not change the time frame_: in the conversions between
   * times and ticks, and the other way around, it always assumes that at tick 0
   * (and frame 0, sample 0, if needed), the time is also 0 (see the
   * @ref DetectorClocksElectronicsTimesNote "note on electronics time frames"
   * above). Therefore, once again, **a clock object does not help in converting
   * between different time scales**, and the output times are in the same time
   * frame as the input.
   *
   * The "default time" is the time the clock is set when returned by the
   * methods with no argument (e.g. `TriggerClock()`).
   *
   * All times (including frame lengths) are measured in microseconds, and all
   * the frequencies are measured in megahertz.
   *
   * `TPCClock()` deals with TPC readout, and the "electronics time" clock is
   * defined to have the same parameters as the TPC readout one.
   *
   * @note The `TriggerClock()` clock has little in common with `TriggerTime()`:
   *       the former is an electronics setting for a piece of hardware
   *       generating the trigger, while the latter is the instant the
   *       @ref DetectorClocksHardwareTrigger "hardware trigger" actually
   *       happened.
   *
   *
   * Note on configuration (and for implementers)
   * =============================================
   *
   * `detinfo::DetectorClocks` is an abstract interface enclosing the set of
   * supported queries. A concrete implementation of this interface needs to be
   * provided in order to use this facility. LArSoft provides
   * `detinfo::DetectorClocksStandard` as a simple, reasonable implementation.
   * Initialization and configuration are designed by each implementation.
   *
   *
   * @todo Add a method to convert electronics time tick into electronics time.

     * The clocks are also the main route to discover the sampling frequency
     * and the period of the electronics. For example:
     * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
     * double const opticalTickDuration = OpticalClock().TickPeriod();
     * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     * will retrieve the "official" optical detector clock period.
     *
     * All times from the clocks (including frame lengths) are measured in
     * microseconds, and all the frequencies are measured in megahertz.
     *
     * Clock objects (`detinfo::ElecClock`) are not bound to any reference time.
     * When specifying a time in one of their methods, whatever the reference of
     * that time is, that is also the reference of the values returned by those
     * methods.
     * The same is true for the time set into the clock at construction: when
     * using one of the methods where _no time_ is required, the time set by
     * `ElecClock::SetTime()` or at construction is used, and whatever the
     * reference of that time is, that is also the reference of the values
     * returned by those methods.
     *
     * Some overview information on clocks is given in the
